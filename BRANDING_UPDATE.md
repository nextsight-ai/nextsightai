NextSight AI unifies them into one intelligent platform.

🎯 ONE PLATFORM FOR:
• Kubernetes management (multi-cluster)
• CI/CD pipeline orchestration
• Security & compliance scanning

• Proactive insights before issues become incidents
• Auto-generated runbooks and fixes
• Security CVEs explained in plain English

🔒 SECURITY BUILT-IN
• Trivy vulnerability scanner included
• A-F security grading
• RBAC analysis for over-permissions
• Real-time compliance monitoring

💰 FREE & OPEN SOURCE
• No cluster limits
• No "contact sales" for features
• No usage restrictions
• MIT License

Built for platform engineers, DevOps teams, and SREs who want
enterprise capabilities without enterprise pricing.

## ✅ Quick Replace Commands

**For bulk updates, use these:**

```bash
# In marketing branch
cd /path/to/nextsight

# Replace "Kubernetes Dashboard"
find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i '' \
  's/The Kubernetes Dashboard That Thinks For You/AI-Powered DevOps Platform for Cloud-Native Teams/g' {} +

# Replace "Kubernetes management platform"
find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i '' \
  's/AI-powered Kubernetes management platform/Open-source DevOps platform with AI-powered Kubernetes management, CI\/CD pipelines,/g' {} +

# Add CI/CD to descriptions
# (Manual review recommended for context)
```

---

## 🎯 Key Takeaway

**Old Positioning:** "Kubernetes Dashboard"
→ Limits perception to K8s monitoring only

**New Positioning:** "DevOps Platform"
→ Positions for current features + future expansion
→ Competes with broader tools (GitLab, Rancher, etc.)
→ Appeals to entire DevOps teams, not just K8s admins
