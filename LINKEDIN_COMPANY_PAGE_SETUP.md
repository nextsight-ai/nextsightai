NextSight AI - AI-Powered DevOps Platform for Cloud-Native Teams

🎯 WHAT WE DO
We build open-source, AI-powered tools that make Kubernetes accessible to everyone - from junior developers to platform architects.

NextSight AI is an intelligent DevOps platform that unifies Kubernetes management, CI/CD pipelines, and security - with AI that explains problems and suggests solutions in plain English.

🤖 AI-FIRST APPROACH
Unlike traditional dashboards that simply display status, NextSight AI:
• Answers questions in plain English: "Why is my pod crashing?"
• Proactively finds issues before they become incidents
• Auto-generates runbooks for common failures
• Explains security vulnerabilities in terms anyone can understand

🔒 SECURITY BUILT-IN
• Trivy vulnerability scanner included (no plugins needed)
• A-F security grading (explain to management in seconds)
• RBAC over-permissions analysis
• Real-time compliance monitoring
• AI-powered remediation with exact fix commands

💻 DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE
• Browser-based kubectl and pod exec terminals
• Visual Helm chart deployment (no more YAML nightmares)
• Debug containers for distroless images
• Self-service portal for common operations
• Multi-cluster management (unlimited, free)

💰 COMPLETELY FREE
No cluster limits. No "contact sales" for features. No usage restrictions.
MIT Licensed. Deploy anywhere. Free forever.
